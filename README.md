## Hey there, I'm Brent Morris (he/him). I'm known online as closetgeekshow usually. 

### I wear many hats 

At work I wear a UX Architect hatðŸŽ©, I've been designing easy-to-use but complex UIs for over 15 years. :
- creating robust responsive design systems 
- bespoke UIs for business applications
- creating answers to unique and complicated questions of design 

My recreational hats: ðŸ¥³ Web Developer, ðŸŽ“ Hobbyist Game Developer, ðŸ‘’ Podfaded Podcaster 

Fascinated by all things webdev, gamedev and novel uses of technology, [my stars](https://github.com/closetgeekshow?tab=stars) are a good clue on what I'm currently thinking about or playing with.
